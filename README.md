# mastermind-rb
This is a Mastermind game solver written in Ruby implementing [Donald Knuth's algorithm](http://www.cs.uni.edu/~wallingf/teaching/cs3530/resources/knuth-mastermind.pdf) to break any code in 5 moves or fewer.

It was inspired by [Adam Forsyth](https://www.adamforsyth.net/)'s talk at RubyConf 2018: "Beating Mastermind: Winning with the help of Donald Knuth"

## Usage
You must have Ruby installed to run this.

Run `ruby main.rb` to start the infinite solver.
